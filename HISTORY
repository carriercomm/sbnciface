    * Fixed BiohZn's commit history fuckup - hi shroud!
    * Attempted to make the sbnciface work out of the box by searching for an usable temporary path for Dwoo.
    * Removed old useless language files build for the old language template.
    * Added some new languages we have got translated so far using the new template.
    * Fixed bug with adding/deleting vhost.
    * Fixed bug with adding/deleting trusted (webserver) ip addresses.
    * Fixed bug with leaving channels.
    * Changed the way we behave no matter if we find vhost.tcl loaded or not.
    * Added support for lock.tcl and hiding the locked settings for normal users.
    * Renamed settings.php to settings.php.example, so we're not overwriting during an update, suggested by Mathias.
    * Added some update checker thing, to warn people if they are using older versions.
